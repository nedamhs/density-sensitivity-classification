"""
Main pipeline for density sensitivity ML analysis.

NEW:
This script implements the complete workflow:
1. Load coulomb matrices from the dictionary 
2. 1st loop - Go through the subsets, and for each reaction in each subset:  
    a) combine matrices according to stoichiometry    
    b) diagonalize the combined matrix   
    c) update max size if exceeded  
    d)append meta data (charge/spin/size of eigenvalue vectoe )
3. Store all in a dictionary 

4. 2nd loop - Go through the subsets again, and for each reaction in each subset:
    a) pad [eigenvalue vector] with zeros to the max size
    b) append charge and mult of product and eigenvalue vector size
    c) add a boolean label for the reaction from SWARM csv
    d) add to the final dataframe

5. Get complete feature matrix and target labels
6. optional - get balanced features and target labels
